# Clipper — Release Notes

**v0.2.2 "copy that represents the clip"** · branch `claude/code-clipper-review-v9e3im`
1 commit · 2 files · `metadata.py`: viral-title craft + a real description

_Dalmislave_

---

## What this is

Titles and descriptions were reading flat: a title could be the first sentence
of the transcript, and a description could come back as nothing but `#Shorts`.
Both are fixed.

## Title craft

The `metadata.py` prompt now asks the model to sell the specific moment, not
the topic: open a curiosity gap, prefer a punchy mini-quote over a label, and
stay true to what is actually said. Verified live: "Gaji Diakuin Kecil, Tapi
Kok Mobilnya Ganti Mulu?" instead of a flat restatement.

## Description must represent the clip

The prompt now requires a 2-3 sentence summary of who or what the clip is and
its key moment, before the hashtags. A fallback in `generate()` does the same
when the router is unreachable: a description of only hashtags is rebuilt from
the transcript, so `#Shorts` alone can never ship again.

## Still broken

Unchanged from v0.2.1: no `cookies.txt` (360p), empty BGM folder (silent
clips), and no Clippo session or uploader tokens (full pipeline only).

**v0.2.1 "9Router on-box"** · branch `claude/code-clipper-review-v9e3im`
1 commit · 2 files, `ai.py` +1 line · AI copy path now works against 9Router
running on the box itself.

_Dalmislave_

---

## What this is

9Router now runs locally on the box (`localhost:20128`) with Dalmi's key, and
the copy path works end to end. Two things changed to make that true.

## Fix: `ai.py` requests a non-streamed reply

9Router streams by default (SSE `data:` chunks), and `ai.py`'s `raw_decode`
could not parse that, so every copy call raised `JSONDecodeError`. The client
now sends `"stream": false` and gets a single `chat.completion` object back.
`ai.py` self-check passes (`chat_json OK`).

## Config: model pinned to one this router serves

The old default `ds/deepseek-v4-pro` is not in this 9Router's catalogue
(26 models, all `cc/*` and `ag/*`). `NINEROUTER_MODEL` is now
`cc/claude-sonnet-5`; cheaper swaps are `cc/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` or
`ag/gemini-3-flash-low`.

## Still broken

- No `cookies.txt`: YouTube capped at 360p, and flagged-VPS requests hit the
  bot-check.
- Empty BGM folder (`bgm/`): clips render silent.
- Clippo session and uploader tokens absent: the full pipeline cannot submit
  or upload. The clip path is unaffected.

**v0.2 "reference style"** · branch `claude/code-clipper-review-v9e3im`
15 commits, 12 files, +1343 / −122 · one new module (`bgm.py`), one new manifest
(`requirements.txt`)

## What this release is

v0.1 proved the spine: crawl Clippo → download → transcribe → pick a segment →
render → upload to YouTube. It looked nothing like the clips it was imitating.

v0.2 is about the picture. The renderer was rebuilt against two reference clips
until the output matches their format, and the parts of the pipeline that
decide *what* gets rendered — how long a clip may be, where it will be posted,
which music sits under it — stopped being hardcoded.

Nothing here changes how tasks are discovered or uploaded.

---

## Renderer

**The footage fills the frame.** `frame_mode="cover"` (new default) crops the
source to 9:16 and uses it as the whole canvas — no band, no blurred fill. The
earlier band was an artifact of feeding it landscape crops. `fill` (a 40% band
over a blurred copy) and `fit` (whole frame letterboxed) remain for landscape
sources, where covering means a hard zoom.

**Phrase captions.** Whole phrases in one colour instead of a per-word
highlight: gold with a heavy black stroke, centred, two lines maximum, with the
punchline tinted magenta. Phrases break where the speaker pauses; when one runs
past six words it is cut at the clearest pause inside the window and continued
as the next caption, never truncated. The per-word karaoke style is still there
behind `caption_style="karaoke"`.

Side effect worth knowing: this is roughly one overlay PNG per phrase instead
of one per word. A 60-second clip drops from ~150 ffmpeg inputs to ~25.

**Pull-quote hook.** A teal quote mark above a stack of white boxes, one per
wrapped line, so the right edge stays ragged. `**Double asterisks**` in the hook
text render bold and the rest regular; an unmarked hook renders bold
throughout. `hook_style="card"` gives the single continuous card instead.

**Two openings.** Pass `intro=` a b-roll clip and the hook lives there, cutting
to the segment when the card leaves — the way both references open. Without one
the hook rides over the opening seconds instead. The trade-off is real: with no
intro, the seconds under the hook carry no subtitle, because nothing is allowed
to share the screen with it.

**Everything stays out of the platform UI.** TikTok, Reels and Shorts paint over
roughly the bottom 15% of the frame. Captions and the hook are both anchored by
their *bottom* edge and grow upward, so neither a long hook nor a three-line
caption can walk off under the app. The self-check asserts it for one-, three-
and five-line hooks.

---

## Music

New `bgm.py`. The model never picks a file — it cannot hear music, and a
hallucinated filename is unrenderable. It labels the *clip* with one of seven
moods, which it can do from the transcript, and the mood resolves to a track
locally against `background_music/tracks.json`. Adding or retiring a track never
touches the prompt, and the label rides along in the metadata call that already
runs per clip, so it costs no extra round-trip.

Within a mood the track is chosen by a stable hash of the clip's identity: the
same clip re-rendered after a retry gets the same track, which `random.choice`
could not promise. Sibling clips of one task exclude each other's track.

Royalty-free is not attribution-free: a manifest entry with an `attribution`
line has it appended to the clip's description before upload.

```json
{"tracks": [
  {"file": "01.mp3", "mood": ["hype"], "attribution": "Music: X by Y (CC BY 4.0)"},
  {"file": "02.mp3", "mood": ["hype", "funny"]}
]}
```

Without a manifest, moods are read from filenames like `03_tense_slowbuild.mp3`.
An empty folder means no BGM, not an error.

---

## Clip length and destinations

**One cut has to fit everywhere it goes.** `duration_window()` takes the whole
destination set and returns the tightest window — highest floor, lowest ceiling.
YouTube Shorts in the set binds at 90s; without it, TikTok's 180 opens up.

| Platform | Window |
|---|---|
| YouTube Shorts | 30–90s |
| TikTok | 30–180s |
| Instagram Reels | 30–90s |

Overridable per host: `CLIPPER_DURATION_YOUTUBE=20-90`.

The old floors were 60s for TikTok and Instagram, which meant a sharp
thirty-second moment could never be clipped for them at all.

**Destinations are derived, not chosen.** The campaign brief says which
platforms it wants; the `accounts` table says where there is an account cleared
for campaign work; only platforms with a working uploader are publishable. The
intersection is the destination set. A human can pin it per campaign from the
dashboard when the rule gets it wrong.

The `accounts` table had been inert since it was written — a paused or banned
account changed nothing. It is now the gate, and it reads the *applied* status:
the promotion `evaluate()` suggests is explicitly not enough, so a bad stat sync
cannot push a platform into campaign work on its own.

Clippo's submission form takes only TikTok and Instagram URLs, so a clip
published to YouTube earns nothing from a campaign. Paying surfaces are
therefore sized on their own; YouTube is a destination only while nothing paying
is live — which is the current state.

---

## Reliability

- `metadata.generate` no longer fails the whole task when 9Router is
  unreachable; it degrades to transcript-derived copy.
- `ai.py` retries transport errors and 5xx with backoff, and still raises 4xx
  immediately.
- Dashboard escaping now covers quotes and `>`. Campaign ids come from Clippo's
  API and reach a `value="..."` attribute.
- Google client imports are lazy, so `pipeline.py --help` and `preflight.py`
  work on a box that has not finished its setup — which is the box being
  diagnosed.

---

## Trying it

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium          # only for Clippo and profile stats
```

Render one clip from a local file — no Clippo, no 9Router, no upload:

```bash
python edit.py preview footage.mp4 --start 0 --end 45 \
  --hook "**Cara Paling Elegan** Nanya Nama Orang Kalau **Kamu Terlanjur Lupa!**" \
  --bgm background_music/01.mp3 --out coba.mp4
```

The transcript comes from faster-whisper and is cached beside the video, so the
second run is instant. Other flags: `--intro`, `--frame-mode`,
`--caption-style`, `--hook-style`, `--words`.

Check a server before a real run, then exercise the whole chain without
spending an upload:

```bash
python preflight.py                  # fonts, ffmpeg, 9Router, session, BGM, accounts
python pipeline.py --dry-run         # renders real clips, uploads nothing
```

`--dry-run` writes no clip rows and no `segment_usage` rows and returns the task
to `DISCOVERED`, so the same segments stay free for the real run.

Every module runs its own checks: `python db.py`, `python segments.py`,
`python bgm.py`, `python edit.py`, and so on.

---

## v0.2.1 — agent entry point

`job.py` is the contract an agent drives: two links in, one clip out.

```bash
python job.py --list                        # catalogue of styles and music, JSON
python job.py --content URL --opening URL   # render, JSON result on stdout
```

Both print JSON on stdout and nothing else; progress goes to stderr and a
failure prints `{"ok": false, "error": ...}` with a non-zero exit, so a caller
never has to read a traceback to tell someone what went wrong. `--list` returns
every choosable style with the label a person should see, plus the music
library, the mood vocabulary and the length windows — enough for an agent to
offer the options without hardcoding them.

The opening link answers a question the renderer had left open: b-roll comes
from the user, per job.

Posting to chat, parsing the request and holding the conversation stay with the
agent, which knows its own transport. This module stops at the file.

**Audio fix that came out of building it.** A BGM track shorter than the clip is
looped, and once it wraps past its own length it hands `amix` packets with no
timestamp; the muxer rejects them and the render fails outright. Re-stamping the
mixed result fixes it. This had been latent — it only shows when the clip
outruns the music, which an intro makes more likely. Verified across the matrix:
intro with and without BGM, BGM without intro, neither, and a clip shorter than
the track.

## v0.2.2 — failure reports, and testing the download on its own

**`report.py`.** A traceback pasted out of a terminal loses what actually
decides the answer: which ffmpeg, whether cookies were there, how much disk was
left, which style the job ran with. Every failure in `job.py` and `pipeline.py`
now writes a JSON report carrying all of it, and the path comes back in the
job's own JSON so a caller can hand it on without shell access to the box.

Set `CLIPPER_GITHUB_TOKEN` and `CLIPPER_GITHUB_REPO` and it also files a GitHub
issue — the one channel a maintainer can read without access to the machine. A
repeat of a failure already open comments on that issue instead of opening
another: failures are fingerprinted by exception type plus the first line with
paths and numbers flattened, so the same wall hit nightly leaves one thread
rather than a pile.

Nothing secret goes in a report. API keys, cookie contents and OAuth tokens are
never read — only whether they are present, which is the diagnostic value. The
self-check asserts none of them appear in the output.

Use a fine-grained token scoped to issues on this repo alone. It sits on the
VPS, so it should be able to do nothing else.

**`python fetch.py URL`** downloads one link and reports what landed. Download
is the only stage that depends on cookies, a PO token and the host's
reputation, so when a job dies at the first step this says whether the link or
the setup is at fault — without spending a whole render to find out.

_Dalmislave_

---

## v0.2.3 — hardening the agent path

Three things that decide whether `job.py` can be pointed at a chat channel
where anyone can paste a link.

**Downloads are keyed by URL, not by run.** Every job used the same folder, and
a Drive fetch walks its whole directory — so the second job picked up the first
job's file. Verified before the fix: two jobs, `max(files, key=getsize)`
returned the previous job's video. Keying by a hash of the URL fixes that and
buys something back: the same link retried with a different style reuses its
download *and* its cached transcript instead of paying for both again. Cached
folders are swept by age (`CLIPPER_MEDIA_TTL_HOURS`, default 24), and the sweep
only touches folders it named, so a pipeline task's media is never pulled out
from under it.

**Input limits.** There were none. A three-hour link meant gigabytes down, an
hour of whisper, and a render behind it. A YouTube link is now checked against
`CLIPPER_MAX_SOURCE_SECONDS` (default 60 min) from its metadata *before* the
download, and everything is checked for size (`CLIPPER_MAX_SOURCE_GB`, default
2) and duration after. The refusal names the actual and the allowed in units
that read at whatever the limit is set to, because that message goes straight
back to whoever sent the link.

If the duration cannot be probed — ffmpeg missing from PATH — the limit is
skipped, but loudly. It used to be skipped in silence, which is the worse
failure: a Drive link has no other guard.

**One job at a time per host.** Whisper and ffmpeg each want most of a small
VPS; two in parallel do not run twice as fast, they run out of memory. A second
request exits `3` with `{"busy": true}` and no failure report — it is not a
fault of that job, and the caller should retry rather than escalate. `--wait N`
blocks instead, for callers that would rather queue.

_Dalmislave_

---

## v0.2.4 — the pipeline survives being killed

The two items that stood at the top of the gap list since the first review.

**A task killed mid-run is no longer lost.** `process()` only ever collected
`DISCOVERED`, so a worker killed during `EDITING` or `UPLOADING` left its task
in a state nothing would ever pick up again. Tasks sitting in a worker-held
state past `CLIPPER_STALE_MINUTES` (default 90 — longer than whisper on a long
video) are swept back into the queue at the start of each run.

**And it resumes rather than restarts.** Rendering is the expensive stage, so
clips an earlier attempt already produced are reused: the resume check runs
*before* segment selection, so a retry skips the model call too. Clip rows now
carry the metadata and account the upload needs, because asking the model again
would put a different title on a file that already exists. Measured on the
crash-and-resume cycle: **zero** extra model calls, and the title on the
published clip is the one from the first attempt.

A rendered file that has gone missing under its clip row is the other case: the
row is dropped and its timestamp released, since nothing can publish it any
more. Requeuing deliberately does *not* release reservations — a clip about to
be resumed would otherwise have its slot claimed by another task mid-flight.

**Failing a task no longer frees another task's segments.** The release deleted
every `segment_usage` row for the video, not the ranges the failing task
reserved. Two campaigns routinely share footage, so one failure re-opened
timestamps another task had already published — and the next run cut and
uploaded the same moment again. It now matches the exact range and skips
anything already out. The regression test builds precisely that situation: two
tasks on one video, one publishes, the other fails, and the published
reservations must survive.

An existing self-check had to be corrected to land this: its fixture inserted a
clip with no start or end, so it only passed because the old code ignored the
range entirely.

_Dalmislave_

---

## v0.2.5 — the render path stands on its own

Confirming what the agent path actually needs, and cutting what it does not.

`classify_source` moved from `clippo.py` to `fetch.py`. It decides which
downloader a link belongs to, so it belongs with the routing table; leaving it
in the Clippo adapter meant anything wanting to download a link imported a
campaign-platform module to find out how. `clippo.py` re-exports it, so the
adapter contract is unchanged.

`job.py` now falls back to heatmap selection when the router is unreachable,
the same ladder `pipeline.py` has always had. It used to raise instead, which
made a 9Router hiccup take the whole chat flow down for something it could
still have produced.

Demonstrated with the router hard-failing on every call: the clip still renders
— topical selection degrades to heatmap, metadata degrades to transcript-derived
copy, music still lands. And with `job.py` loaded and a job run, none of
`clippo`, `playwright`, `db`, `sqlite3`, `accounts`, `pipeline` or
`upload_youtube` is imported at all. The render path touches no campaign
platform, no database and no upload credentials.

_Dalmislave_

---

## v0.2.6 — the download path is exercised, not just described

The downloader is `fetch.py`. There is no `download.py` — that was the old
"Clipper Gemini" name, and nothing in this repo answers to it.

Until now the network stages were the untested half: routing and the file
filter were covered, but `fetch_youtube` and `fetch_gdrive` themselves had
never run, in CI or anywhere. That mattered more than usual because v0.2.3 put
a duration pre-check inside `fetch_youtube` — new code on the one path nothing
executed.

Both are now driven against stubbed `yt_dlp` and `gdown` modules. What that
actually covers:

* an over-long video is refused **before** the download — asserted by checking
  yt-dlp was called once with `download=False` and never with `download=True`;
* the merged-extension fallback, where yt-dlp reports `.webm` and the file on
  disk is the muxed `.mp4`;
* the heatmap sidecar being written, and read back by `heatmap_for`;
* no heatmap offered meaning no sidecar, which is not an error;
* the 360p warning firing when a download comes back under 720p;
* a Drive folder that rate-limits mid-way still returning what landed, with the
  brief PDF filtered out of the footage;
* a Drive file share that returns nothing coming back empty rather than
  crashing.

What this still does not cover, and cannot from here: the network itself.
Cookies, PO tokens and a host's reputation with YouTube are only testable on
the host. `python fetch.py URL` is that test.

_Dalmislave_

---

## v0.2.7 — stop capping the download at 1080p

360p is an authentication question, not a limit: YouTube serves it to
unauthenticated requests, and `cookies.txt` opens the full ladder. That was
already documented and is unchanged.

The real cap was in the format selector, which asked for
`bestvideo[ext=mp4]`. YouTube only publishes H.264 up to 1080p — everything
above that exists as VP9 or AV1 in webm — so pinning the container pinned the
resolution, cookies or not.

That matters because cover mode crops a landscape source to 9:16 and throws
away most of the width before filling the canvas:

| source | after the 9:16 crop | to 1080x1920 |
|---|---|---|
| 1080p | 607x1080 | upscaled 1.78x |
| 1440p | 810x1440 | upscaled 1.33x |
| 2160p | 1215x2160 | downscaled 1.12x |

A 1080p source is being blown up nearly twice over. The selector now caps by
height instead of container, defaulting to `CLIPPER_MAX_HEIGHT=1440` —
visibly better through a crop without the file size 2160p brings against
`CLIPPER_MAX_SOURCE_GB`. The `<=?` is a preference, so a video published only
above the cap still downloads rather than failing to match.

The stub test pins both halves: the selector must carry the height cap, and
must not name a container. Re-pinning mp4 for tidiness would silently put the
1080p ceiling back, so it fails the test instead.

Merged output may now be mkv when the best pair cannot go in mp4. That is
already handled — mkv is in the accepted extensions, and the renderer
re-encodes everything anyway.

_Dalmislave_

---

## v0.2.8 — the download says what it actually got

v0.2.7 raised the ceiling to 1440p but left no way to see whether the ceiling
or the source decided the result. `python fetch.py URL` reported a path and a
byte count; a 1080p download and a 1440p one look the same in bytes unless you
already know the video.

The CLI now reports resolution. Each file comes back with `width`, `height`
and `codec`, and the envelope carries `max_height` — the ceiling that was
asked for, next to the height that arrived. Those two numbers together are the
whole diagnosis: equal means the cap decided it, lower means the source did,
360p means cookies are not being read.

```json
{ "ok": true, "kind": "youtube", "cookies": true, "max_height": 1440,
  "files": [ { "path": "...", "size_bytes": 214_000_000,
               "codec": "vp9", "width": 2560, "height": 1440 } ] }
```

`preflight.py` reports the same thing: the configured ceiling as its own line,
and the resolution of whatever sample it ends up using. A sample under 720p
now fails a check rather than passing quietly — through a 9:16 crop that is an
upscale past 2x, which is the soft-looking output this whole thread started
from.

Both read it out of the `ffmpeg -i` banner rather than calling ffprobe, for the
same reason `probe_seconds` does: a static ffmpeg build often ships without
ffprobe beside it. When ffmpeg is missing the fields are simply absent — the
download is still reported, since not knowing the resolution is not a reason to
call a successful download a failure.

**What is not proven.** The banner parser is checked against fixture output
(h264 with SAR/DAR trailing the resolution, VP9, AV1, audio-only, empty), not
against a live ffmpeg — this environment has neither ffmpeg nor network. The
SAR/DAR case is the one worth knowing about: `2560x1440 [SAR 1:1 DAR 16:9]`
puts two more ratio-shaped tokens right after the resolution, and a parser that
grabs the wrong one reports a 1x1 video, which would read as a broken download.
That case is pinned by the self-check.

## v0.3 - antislop, and what it found

[antislop](https://github.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop) is a filter that stops
an agent producing the generic output a model defaults to. Six skills are
checked into `.claude/skills/` at a pinned upstream commit, and `CLAUDE.md`
points at them, so they load in every session from the next one onward.

Checked in rather than fetched: the version cannot change under a session
mid-task, and nothing downloads its own next instructions at runtime.

### Where the rules apply here

The core forbids the em dash "in any text". In this repo that means the text
the project **ships**: what is drawn on a clip, posted with it, or rendered by
the dashboard. Python comments and these notes are internal prose, governed by
the code-comment skill, which says nothing about dashes. Rewriting a thousand
comments would have been churn, not craft. The line is written down in
`CLAUDE.md` so the next session does not relitigate it.

### The copy that ships on every clip

`metadata.py` writes the hook, title and description with an LLM, and that copy
goes on the frame and under our own accounts. The prompt now states the
constraints, and, because a prompt constraint is a request a model can decline,
the ones that matter are enforced after the reply lands:

- **Connector dashes are replaced.** Em dash, en dash, and the spaced double
  hyphen, in all three fields.
- **A figure the speaker never said is dropped.** The clause carrying it is
  removed before anything renders. A hook that loses its only sentence falls
  back to transcript-derived copy rather than shipping a lone emoji.
- **Filler is reported, not rewritten.** Cutting a phrase out of a sentence
  usually leaves worse copy than the phrase did, so the run prints what it saw.

The number rule only fires on figures carrying a scale or a unit (`%`, juta,
ribu, kali lipat). A bare small count is a count, not a statistic: "cuma butuh
2 menit" survives. A figure the transcript does contain is reporting, not
invention, and survives too. Both cases are pinned by the self-check.

Why it matters more than it sounds: an invented "90% orang gagal" on a clip is
a fabricated statistic published under an account we are trying to keep alive.

### The dashboard, measured rather than eyeballed

The audit found real defects, not style opinions:

| Finding | Rule | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| Muted text, table headers and links in light mode | R-25 | 2.53:1 to 3.08:1, under the 4.5:1 floor |
| Platform checkbox labels in light mode | R-34 | 1.18:1, effectively invisible |
| Five of six status pills | R-25 | white on the pill measured 2.52:1 to 3.85:1 |
| Eight-column table on a phone | R-03 | the page scrolled sideways |
| Buttons at 24px tall | R-03 | under the 44px tap target |
| No focus style anywhere | R-32 | keyboard users could not see their position |
| `/warmup` and `/delete` unguarded | R-27 | a DB error gave a raw 500 instead of the error banner |
| Palette | R-30 | GitHub's dark theme, hex for hex |

All fixed. The palette is not replaced with invented taste: it reuses
`edit.py`'s `QUOTE_TEAL` and `PHRASE_COLOR`, both sampled off the reference
clips, on warm neutrals. The console and the clips it ships now look related,
and every choice has a one-line reason next to it in the CSS.

Teal carries links and the primary action. Gold is the single accent and
appears once, on `campaign_ready`, the only status that means an account can
take work. Status pills went from white text to ink text, which is what fixed
their contrast.

### Verified in a browser, not asserted

Chromium drove the page at 375px and 1280px, in both themes: zero horizontal
overflow, every rendered text node measured against its real computed
background, every control at least 44px on a phone, a focus ring on all 14 tab
stops, no console errors, and all seven controls clicked one at a time.
16 of 16. `antislop-human/contrast-check.py` confirmed every pairing
independently.

Sync fails in that run for an unrelated reason: this container's Playwright
build does not match its bundled Chromium. It failed into the dashboard's own
error banner, which is the error state doing its job.

### Comments

Eleven banner comments built from rules of dashes lost the decoration and kept
their words. Nothing else changed: the density scan came back clean, with no
step narration, no empty labels, no vague TODOs and no end markers.

## v0.3.1 - the renderer stops working on a newer ffmpeg

Found while trying to render a clip on a 2026 ffmpeg build: **every render
fails on ffmpeg 8**, with nothing useful to go on.

```
RuntimeError: ffmpeg failed: Unrecognized option 'filter_complex_script'.
```

ffmpeg 8 dropped `-filter_complex_script` for the generic `-/filter_complex`.
`edit.py` had the old spelling hardcoded, so the day a box upgrades ffmpeg the
pipeline stops rendering, and the error names an option rather than the
problem. Nothing about the failure suggests "your ffmpeg is too new".

The graph still has to come from a file, because one caption is one overlay
input and the command line would otherwise hit the OS argument limit. Only the
spelling was in question, so the binary is asked once and the answer cached:
`-filter_complex_script` when `ffmpeg -h full` still lists it, otherwise
`-/filter_complex`. Version strings were not used to decide. Distro builds,
static builds and vendored builds all disagree about what a version means, and
the capability is the thing that matters.

Verified against both: ffmpeg n7.0.1 picks the old flag, N-126482 picks the
new one, and a clip renders on the new one to 1080x1920 H.264 with audio.

That render also settled something v0.2.8 left open. The `ffmpeg -i` banner
parser behind `probe_video` had only ever been checked against fixtures, since
no ffmpeg was available at the time. It now reads a live banner correctly at
both ends of the pipeline: 1920x1080 h264 in, 1080x1920 h264 out.

## v0.3.2 - the repo sets itself up

Everything needed to clone this and get to a rendered clip is now in the repo,
so the instructions do not have to travel separately.

**`README.md`** (the repo had none). Two setup paths, because they cost very
different amounts: the clip path needs four Python packages and no credentials
at all, the full pipeline needs twelve plus a Clippo session and upload tokens.
It leads with the branch warning, since `main` is around 3000 lines behind and
does not contain `job.py`, `bgm.py` or `report.py`.

**`AGENTS.md`.** The three commands an agent needs, the `job.py` contract, and
what exit 3 means, so a busy host reads as "retry later" rather than a failure.

**`.env.example`.** Every variable the code reads is either set here with a
note, or named in the closing list with the module that owns its default. A
check confirms none is missing. Nothing in the file is required to render a
clip, which the file says up front.

**`requirements-clip.txt`.** Four packages: yt-dlp, faster-whisper, Pillow,
requests. `requirements.txt` pulls this file in with `-r` rather than repeating
it, so a version is defined once. Both were resolved with `pip install
--dry-run`, not just eyeballed.

What the clip path does not need, confirmed by importing `job.py` in a
container that has none of them: fastapi, uvicorn, python-multipart, playwright,
gdown, and the three google packages. Every heavy import in the chain sits
inside a function rather than at the top of a module, which is what makes that
work.

### The self-check now renders

`python edit.py` used to print `smoke skipped: fetch media/3 first` on any box
that had not already downloaded one specific video, which meant a fresh clone
verified the layout maths and nothing else.

It now builds its own source with ffmpeg when no footage is around: 1920x1080
with an audio track, so the 9:16 crop and the amix path both do real work, then
renders both modes. No network, no keys, no footage. On a fresh box this is the
first command worth running, and its output says whether the machine can render
at all.

## v0.3.3 - the clip is too big to send

Writing the Hermes prompt turned up a hole in the plan it describes. The render
targets 6 Mbps, because that file is the one uploaded to TikTok or YouTube. A
90 second clip is therefore about 66 MB, and Discord takes 10 MB on a free
account. The chat step of the plan could not have worked.

`job.py --max-mb N` now writes a second, smaller copy when the render is over
the limit, and returns both paths:

```json
{"file": "/path/clip.mp4",       "size_bytes": 46000000,
 "delivery_file": "/path/clip_small.mp4", "delivery_size_bytes": 9100000}
```

The original is untouched: the small one is for looking at, the full one is for
publishing, and the prompt tells the agent to say which is which so nobody
posts the compressed copy to a platform. Default is 0, meaning off, so the
pipeline is unaffected. Verified on the 13.9 MB test render: a 9 MB cap
produced 8.0 MB, a 45 MB cap correctly produced nothing.

What it cannot do is make the arithmetic kinder. Fitting 90 seconds of
1080x1920 into 9 MB means 0.7 Mbps, and no encoder setting rescues that. On a
free Discord account a 90 second clip cannot arrive looking good; Nitro Basic
at 50 MB is the only option that keeps the plan intact, and `hermes-prompt.md`
gives the numbers rather than leaving it to be discovered during a demo.

**`hermes-prompt.md`** holds the system prompt itself: the catalogue-first
flow, the two-link contract, what exit 3 means, which file to upload, and how
to read a failure without pasting a traceback into a chat. Every flag it names
was checked against `job.py`, and every number in it recomputed.

## v0.3.4 - no hook unless one was asked for

Every clip used to get a hook, because `metadata.generate()` always writes one
and `job.py` always passed it to the renderer. Sending only a content link
still produced a headline over the first seconds, written by the model because
nothing stopped it.

A hook is now drawn only when something asks for one:

| Given | Hook |
|---|---|
| `--hook "text"` | the text, over the opening clip or the content |
| an opening link | written for it, from the topical pick or the model |
| neither | none |

The rule lives in `_hook_for()` rather than inline, because it is a contract an
agent offers a user rather than an implementation detail, and `job.py
--selftest` pins all seven cases along with the catalogue and the delivery cap.
That flag is new: it checks the parts that are a promise, without touching the
network.

This costs nothing and returns something. The seconds under a hook carry no
subtitle, since nothing is allowed to share the screen with it, so a hook
nobody asked for was eating the opening line of speech. Rendered both ways from
the same source and the same window: at two seconds in, the hooked version
shows the hook and no caption, the plain one is already captioning "jadi gue
dulu mikir bikin konten".

`README.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `hermes-prompt.md` all say it now, and the
catalogue's "direct" entry no longer describes the old behaviour.

## v0.3.5 - a prompt that fits in a Discord message

The prompt written in v0.3.3 was 5023 characters. A free Discord account caps a
message at 2000, so it could not be sent as one, which is how it was meant to
be delivered.

`hermes-prompt.md` now carries both. The short one is 1969 characters with 31
to spare for editing `--max-mb`. It drops the setup commands, which are a
one-time job better sent separately, and compresses the failure taxonomy to the
three cases that actually recur.

What survives untouched is the hook rule, stated at the same length as before.
It is the part that changes what lands on the video, and the part an agent is
most likely to be helpful about in exactly the wrong way.

The long version stays for a config field or a Nitro account, where the cap is
4000. Every flag named in both was checked against `job.py`'s parser again
after the cut.

## Known gaps

Read this before relying on the pipeline unattended.

- **No view checker.** `submit_eligible()` filters on `views_last_checked`,
  which nothing writes, so Clippo submission never fires.
- **`recent_avg_views` is never written**, so the dashboard's shadowban
  detection cannot trigger.
- **The b-roll intro is not wired into the pipeline.** `render_clip` accepts it;
  `pipeline.py` never passes one, because where b-roll comes from is undecided.
- **TikTok and Instagram uploaders do not exist**, so those windows are
  unreachable in practice.
- **No BGM ducking.** Music sits at a fixed 0.1 under speech rather than
  stepping back for it.
- **`job.py` has no Discord side.** It renders and returns JSON; delivering the
  file and holding the conversation are the agent's.
- **No queue.** A busy host refuses rather than holding the request; whether
  that is right depends on how the agent handles a retry.
- **No `DESIGN.md`.** The dashboard borrows the clip palette, which is a real
  source, but there is no written direction for anything new. Under antislop's
  own rule that makes new UI a draft, not a deliverable, until someone writes
  the direction down.
- **The renderer was not audited against antislop.** `edit.py` draws on video
  frames, and the rules are written for web UI: the contrast checker assumes a
  flat background, and a caption sits over moving footage. The reference clips
  remain the standard there.
- **The network itself is untested.** The download logic is driven against
  stubbed yt-dlp and gdown, but nothing here reaches YouTube or Drive; cookies,
  PO tokens and IP reputation are only testable on the host, with
  `python fetch.py URL` — which now reports the resolution it got, so one run
  answers both whether cookies work and whether the 1440p cap took effect.

## Notes for whoever clones this

`edit.py` is where almost all of this release lives, and its constants at the
top are the knobs — canvas, colours, caption and hook geometry, safe-area
fractions. They were measured off the reference clips rather than guessed, and
the numbers are in the comments next to them.

Secrets stay out of the repo: `.env`, `cookies.txt`, `clippo_session.json` and
`tokens/` are gitignored and have to be placed by hand. `preflight.py` tells you
which are missing.
